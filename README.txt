Welcome To My Steam Game!

This is a current project I have been working on, to hopefully be a full game on steam that you all can play.
This document will talk about future plans, and a current TODO list that I am focusing on.

Future Plans / Game Idea

Take Plants VS Zombies 2 and combine it with The Battle Cats. That is what I am going for.
Your average level will have a tower defence like structure. Each side (you and the level) will have a tower with a certain amount of HP.
You win when the opponents tower has no HP.
To lower the opponents' towers health, you must spawn different types of food.

This game will be a gacha game, where you spend tokens earned in various different ways to discover new food types.
You can upgrade these food types to higher levels where they will gain different stats.
If you role the same food type for a type you already have, you may gain 1 free level from the roll (max level is 100)
If you are at the maximum level for a food, the food may be traded for xp or other various means (COMING SOON)

Anyways back to the gameplay. 
You can place your food anywhere from your tower to the center point in the map. 
The map is a tile based on something similar to PvZ2, except there is one difference.
Once placed on the map food will move towards the enemy tower, attacking anything in their way.
The level will do the same, placing down different types of creatures to block your food. 
When a creature meets food on the battlefield, it will attempt to defeat it, to get to the tower.
Enemys and creatures cannot switch lanes, however there might be exceptions (COMING SOON)

To place a food down, you need money.
In level money can be aquired via time. Something called your efficiency will determine how quickly you can get money
Efficiency can be upgraded in the menu up to level 100
Once a food is placed down, it goes into cooldown. This cooldown depends on the food, but general cooldown can be lowered via leveling it up in the menu

There will be many levels including story levels, event levels, special sideline quests, and epic bossfights.
All of these will give XP and tokens.

There are 6 rarities of food. Common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary, exclusive.
Here are the approximate chances of getting one of the foods:
Common: 47%
Uncommon: 30.4%
Rare: 15.5%
Epic: 5%
Legendary: 2%
Exclusive: 0.1%

In this game there will be different events depending on the week. Events are as follows:

Monday - European
Tuesday - Drinks
Wednesday - American
Thursday - Asian
Friday - Seafood
Saturday - Desserts
Sunday - Jackpot Day

In this game there is a class system. The class system is used so different characters can be stronger then others. 
Characters that use these classes need what is called abilities. Abilites can be something like resistance, extra damage, etc.
If a character (food or creature) is in a class and has an ability, then the ability will be activated on ANY CLASS BELOW IT (exceptions)
eg: an assassin's ability is effective against everything below it (fearless, brute, none)
There is only one exception and that is the Annihilator.
The annihilator's abilities work on every class except the None class
One last thing is that abilities do not work on enemies with the same class
